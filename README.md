## 🧭 My Core Thesis

Every company I work with faces the same bottleneck:  
> **Web infrastructure that doesn’t scale with growth.**

I solve this by combining **engineering precision** (React, Node.js, PHP, AWS) with **product awareness** (SEO, conversions, performance) — so businesses don’t just get *code that works*, but systems that **pay for themselves in growth, uptime, and revenue saved**.

- 🏗️ Managed **500+ WordPress multisites** with 99.9% uptime and automated CI/CD  
- 💰 Saved companies **$1M+ in ops costs** by automating monitoring & deployment pipelines  
- ⚡ Reduced **deployment time from days → hours** with Docker + GitLab CI/CD  
- 🎯 Trained and mentored teams, cutting debug cycles by **90%**
